# CXT

A powerful command-line tool for developers to extract and share code context. CXT concatenates files with specified extensions, formats them as markdown with proper syntax highlighting, and can intelligently filter content using AI to focus on specific features or functionality.

## Features

- **Intelligent File Collection**: Search for files with specified extensions across directory structures
- **Markdown Formatting**: Generate well-structured markdown documents with proper syntax highlighting
- **AI-Powered Context Filtering**: Use Gemini AI to identify files relevant to specific functionality
- **Clipboard Integration**: Automatically copy formatted output to clipboard on macOS
- **Smart Ignore System**: Respect `.gitignore` and `.clineignore` files at every directory level
- **Path Expansion**: Support for home directory (`~`) and relative paths
- **Customizable Filtering**: Add additional ignore patterns through command-line options
- **Developer-Friendly Output**: Clear indication of processed files and filtered results

## Installation

```bash
brew tap 1amageek/cxt https://github.com/1amageek/cxt.git
brew install 1amageek/cxt/cxt
```

### API Key Setup

To use the context filtering feature with Gemini AI, you need to set up a Google AI API key:

1. Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

To make the API key persistent across terminal sessions, add it to your shell profile:

```bash
# For Bash (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile)
echo 'export GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here' >> ~/.bash_profile

# For Zsh (add to ~/.zshrc)
echo 'export GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage

### Basic Command Format
```bash
cxt <extensions> <directory-path> [prompt] [options]
```

### Arguments

- `<extensions>`: File extensions to search for (comma-separated, without dots)
  - Example: `swift` or `swift,md,json`
- `<directory-path>`: Directory path to search in (supports ~ for home directory)
  - Example: `./` or `~/Projects/MyApp`
- `[prompt]`: Optional prompt to identify related files for contextual filtering
  - Example: `"Find files related to user authentication"`

### Options

- `-v`: Enable verbose output for detailed processing information
- `-i <patterns>`: Additional ignore patterns (comma-separated)
  - Example: `-i "Tests/,*.generated.swift"`
- `--help`: Show the help information and command descriptions

### Examples

```bash
# Basic: Swift files in current directory
cxt swift ./

# Multiple file types: Swift, Markdown, and JSON files
cxt swift,md,json ~/Documents

# Web development: TS, TSX, and CSS files, ignoring node_modules
cxt ts,tsx,css . -i node_modules

# React project: Components and styles with context filtering
cxt ts,tsx,css ./src "Find components related to user dashboard" 

# Context filtering: Find networking-related files
cxt swift ./MyProject "Find files related to networking and HTTP requests"

# Verbose mode with custom ignore patterns
cxt -v swift ./MyProject -i "Tests/,*.generated.swift"

# Combine options: Verbose, context filtering, and custom ignore patterns
cxt -v swift ./MyProject "Find authentication logic" -i "*.generated.swift"

# Use in a directory with spaces
cxt swift "~/My Projects/Swift App"

# Expanded path with context filtering
cxt swift ~/Developer/MyApp "Find code related to Core Data models"
```

## Ignore File Support

CXT intelligently handles file exclusions to ensure you process only the relevant files.

### Default Ignore Behavior

CXT respects the following ignore files at every directory level:

- `.gitignore` - Standard Git ignore patterns
- `.clineignore` - Custom ignore patterns specific to CXT

### Built-in Ignore Patterns

By default, CXT automatically ignores these common directories and files:

- `node_modules/` - NPM dependencies
- `.git/` - Git repository metadata
- `.DS_Store` - macOS filesystem metadata
- `.build/` - Swift build artifacts
- `*.xcodeproj` - Xcode project files

### Custom Ignore Patterns

To add project-specific ignore patterns, you can:

1. Create a `.clineignore` file in your project directories
2. Use the `--ignore-patterns` command-line option

#### Using .clineignore Files

Creating a `.clineignore` file uses the same pattern format as `.gitignore`:

```
# Example .clineignore file
# Ignore build artifacts
dist/
build/

# Ignore generated code
*.generated.swift

# Ignore temporary files
*.tmp
```

#### Using --ignore-patterns Option

For temporary or ad-hoc ignores, use the command-line option:

```bash
# Ignore all test files in addition to default ignores
cxt swift ./MyProject --ignore-patterns="*_test.swift,*_spec.swift,Tests/"

# Ignore generated files and documentation
cxt swift,md ./MyProject --ignore-patterns="*.generated.swift,docs/"

# Combine verbose mode with custom ignore patterns
cxt -v swift ./MyProject --ignore-patterns="build/,*.tmp"
```

### Ignore Pattern Syntax

CXT supports standard glob pattern syntax:

- `*` - Matches any number of characters (except /)
- `**` - Matches any number of directories recursively
- `?` - Matches a single character
- `[abc]` - Matches one character in the brackets
- `dir/` - Trailing slash indicates a directory match
- `#` - Lines starting with # are comments

## Context Filtering

CXT includes a powerful AI-powered context filtering feature that helps you extract only the files relevant to a specific task or feature.

### How Context Filtering Works

The optional prompt parameter activates context-aware filtering:

```bash
cxt swift ./MyApp "Find files related to authentication"
```

When you provide a prompt, CXT will:

1. First scan and collect all matching files based on the extension
2. Generate a markdown document with all collected files
3. Submit this document along with your prompt to the Gemini AI model
4. Analyze the context and determine which files are relevant to your prompt
5. Filter the final output to include only the relevant files
6. Print the filtered file paths to stderr and copy the content to clipboard

### Example Use Cases

```bash
# Find networking implementation
cxt swift ./MyApp "Find files related to network requests and API communication"

# Extract authentication system
cxt swift ./MyApp "Find code implementing user login, registration, and session management"

# Locate database-related code
cxt swift ./MyApp "Find files related to database models and persistence"

# Find UI components for a specific feature
cxt swift,swift,xib ./MyApp "Find code implementing the shopping cart interface"
```

### Understanding the Output

When context filtering is active, CXT will print the filtered file list to stderr:

```
Filtered content based on context:
  - Sources/Networking/APIClient.swift
  - Sources/Networking/RequestBuilder.swift
  - Sources/Models/NetworkResponse.swift
âœ¨ Done! Processed 3 files (.swift)
```

> **Note**: Context filtering requires a valid Google AI API key. See the [API Key Setup](#api-key-setup) section.

The context filtering uses the Gemini 2.0 Pro model (gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05) to intelligently analyze your codebase.

## Output Format

CXT generates a well-structured markdown document that's perfect for sharing code context with AI assistants or colleagues.

### Markdown Format

The output follows this format:

~~~markdown
---
created_at: 2025-04-15 10:51:17
extensions: [.swift]
base_path: /path/to/directory
---

# path/to/file1.swift

```swift
// Content of file1.swift
```

# path/to/file2.swift

```swift
// Content of file2.swift
```
~~~

### Output Components

1. **Frontmatter Header**:
   - `created_at`: Timestamp when the document was generated
   - `extensions`: List of file extensions included in the document
   - `base_path`: The root directory where the scan started

2. **File Sections**:
   - Each file is represented as a heading with its relative path
   - File content is enclosed in a code block with appropriate language syntax highlighting

### Clipboard Integration

The formatted content is automatically copied to your clipboard on macOS, making it ready to:

- Paste into AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini
- Share with colleagues via messaging platforms
- Insert into documentation or wikis
- Use with other text processing tools

This seamless clipboard integration eliminates the need for manual copying or file handling.

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- macOS 14.0 or later
- Swift 6.0 or later

### Dependencies
CXT is built using the following Swift packages:
- [SwiftAgent](https://github.com/1amageek/SwiftAgent.git) - For AI-powered context analysis
- [Swift Argument Parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser.git) - For command-line interface

### For Context Filtering
- Google AI API key (Gemini model)
- Environment variable `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY` must be set

## Use Cases

CXT is especially useful for:

- **AI Prompt Engineering**: Prepare code context for LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini)
- **Web Development**: Extract TS, JS, and CSS files from React or Angular projects
- **Mobile Development**: Gather Swift files for iOS or Kotlin for Android
- **Code Reviews**: Share relevant parts of a codebase with colleagues
- **Documentation**: Extract code samples for technical documentation
- **Debugging**: Collect related files to understand an issue's scope
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand specific parts of a codebase

### Web Development Example

For a typical React or Next.js project:

```bash
# Extract all TS/TSX/CSS files, ignoring node_modules
cxt ts,tsx,css . -i node_modules

# Find components related to a specific feature
cxt ts,tsx,css ./src "Find components related to user authentication" -i "node_modules,*test*"

# Extract styles and components for a specific page
cxt ts,tsx,css,scss ./src/pages/dashboard "Extract dashboard components" -i node_modules
```

### Mobile Development Example

When working on iOS apps:

```bash
# Extract SwiftUI views 
cxt swift ./Sources "Find all view files" -i "Tests/,*.generated.swift"

# Gather database or Core Data related files
cxt swift . "Find files related to database models and persistence"
```
